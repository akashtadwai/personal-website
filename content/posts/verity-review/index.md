Have you ever read a book and thought, "WTF did I just read!" Verity is definitely one of them for me. It is a creepy, captivating, dark, and twisted story that keeps you awake until you finish it. The story revolves around Lowen Ashleigh, a struggling author, a man called Jeremy Crawford, and Jeremy's wife, Verity, who was recently left disabled by a car accident. 

Although Verity is a successful writer, the accident prevents her from continuing her best-selling series. That's why Lowen was brought in to complete the remaining three books. To do so, she stays at the couple's house to go through Verity's work. But Lowen finds something else in Verity's office, an incomplete autobiography. Her fear intensifies as she reads. Lowen begins to dig into dark truths about the family and the deaths of their twin daughters. At the same time, she finds herself falling for Jeremy and wonders if she should reveal the truth to him. 

The story surely made me not trust any authors :winking_face: Essentially the book revolves around the author Colleen Hoover, writing about another author reading about another author; you constantly have the feeling that someone is lying to you, but who is it? That's not that simple to tell. If you find psychological thrillers interesting, this book won't disappoint you for sure!
